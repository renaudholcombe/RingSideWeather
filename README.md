RingSideWeather
===============
This project is to build a motion-activated weather display station out of an old boxing timer. At the core is a wifi-enabled arduino within the timer that communicates with a service running on an OS X server running the service application. 

The service consumes data from NOAA and allows for configuration of the upper, mid and lower bounds along with when inclement weather indicators.

Enjoy!
